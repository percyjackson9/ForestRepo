Created from data set FLG9_1.0 from FMOS. Stand id is identical to data set.
Each period corresponds to 5 years.

Files:

	-area.area   Stand area in hectares. From the data set shape file.
	-acX.age     Initial age for stands for age class structure X. Age in years
		     is (age_class-1)*5 where age_class is obtained from the data set
		     shape file.
	-acX_PPP.volume Volume in m^3 for age class structure X and product PPP. Obtained
                        from VolumeCase_X.csv from the data set. Products SW=SWLOG+SWFIB, 
			HW=HWLOG+HWFIB, total=SW+HW
	-acX_PPP.profit Profit for age class structure X and product PPP. Obtained from 
			acX_PPP.volume by considering a profit of 90 per m^3 and a
			3% anual discount rate. 
	-distance_D.adjacency Adjacency considering two stands adjacent if the distance
			      between them is <= D meters
	-strong.adjacency   Adjacency considering two stands adjacent if the number of points
			    in their intersection is strictly greater than 1
