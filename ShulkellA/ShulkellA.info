Created from data set Shulkell from FMOS. Stands are numbered in the order in which they
appear both in forest.shp and shulkell.stands.txt (e.g. stand 1 corresponds to stand #7469 in shulkell.stands.txt).

Files:
	-area.area Stand area in acres. Extracted from shulkell.stands.txt. 
	-age.age Initial age for stands in years. Extracted from shulkell.stands.txt. See assumptions bellow.
	-volume.volume Volume in cu ft. Constructed from shulkell.stands.txt and Shulkell.maidata.txt. See assumptions bellow 
	-profit.profit Obtained from volume.volume by considering a profit of $90 per m^3 and a 3% annual discount rate.
	-line.adjacency Adjacency considering two stands adjacent if the number of points in their intersection is strictly greater than 1.
        -point.adjacency Adjacency considering two stands adjacent if they intersect.

Files created with the following assumptions:

 	-15 periods of 5 years each are generated
	-"Site Index" in Shulkell.stand.txt is equal to "land class" in 
	Shulkell.maidata.txt. 
	-"Ageclass" in Shulkell.stand.txt is initial age of a stand.
	-"Current Volume (cu ft)" in Shulkell.stand.txt is initial volume of
	stand
	-Volumes for first period are "Current Volume (cu ft)" in Shulkell.stand.txt. Volume for
	other periods were generated by adding volume increment given by MAI
	to volume in previous period. See generateShulkellVolume.py.
	-MAI for land class 2 was not included in Shulkell.maidata.txt. Assumed
	this was equal to land class 4.
	-Stands with age >22 used MAI for age=22.
	-Volumes were rounded down to integers.
